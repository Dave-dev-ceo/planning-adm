  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/

  fonts:
    - family: BubbleBee
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/BubbleBee.ttf

    - family: Comfortaa
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Comfortaa-Regular.ttf

    - family: Dancing
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/DancingScript-Medium.ttf

    - family: Montserrat
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Montserrat.ttf

    - family: Montserrat-Medium
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Montserrat-Medium.ttf
  
    - family: Delberg
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Delberg.ttf

    - family: MyFlutterApp
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/MyFlutterApp.ttf

    - family: Quaylike
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Quaylike.ttf

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
